Part 3: Understanding Chef Cookbook/Recipe.



I) Extending existing Cookbook (cookbook-test) and configure a recipe for deploying Packages.
1) Login to Workstation node which have knife configured.
2) Lets say you have not yet install sendmail on your system, check it out using following command:

   # rpm -qa | grep -v grep | grep -i sendmail


Note: In case if sendmail is installed and you want to delete it please refer to my rpm page.

3) Now lets create a recipe for a sendmail package.

   # vim /usr/local/src/chef/cookbooks/cookbook-test/recipes/sendmail.rb
     package 'sendmail' do
        action :install
     end

4) To upload a cookbook (cookbook-test) use following command:

   # knife upload cookbooks cookbook-test

5) Once we have upload the cookbook, now is the time to associate it with a Node using “run_list” Knife option:

   # knife node run_list add node1.example.com recipe[cookbook-test::sendmail]
     node1.example.com:
       run_list:
         recipe[cookbook-test]
         recipe[cookbook-test::sendmail]

6) Now login to machine “node1.example.com” and run the following command:

   # chef-client

     end

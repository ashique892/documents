After creating create a workstation machine and setup .chef directory for managing knife command.
knife enables you to upload your cookbooks to the Chef server and work with nodes, the servers that you manage.

knife requires two files to authenticate with the Chef server.

1) RSA private key

Every request to the Chef server is authenticated through an RSA public key pair. The Chef server holds the public part; you hold the private part.

2) a knife configuration file

The configuration file is typically named knife.rb. It contains information such as the Chef server's URL, the location of your RSA private key, and the default location of your cookbooks.

Both of these files are typically located in a directory named .chef. By default, every time knife runs, it looks in the current working directory for the .chef directory. If the .chef directory does not exist, knife searches up the directory tree for a .chef directory. This process is similar to how tools such as Git work.

Create the ~/learn-chef/.chef directory, like this. You'll add your RSA private key and knife configuration files in the next steps.
